scripts useful for rucio transfer from FNAL to SLAC

filelist.txt is generated via 
`samweb list-definition-files $sam_definition > filelist.txt`
(e.g.)
`samweb list-definition-files TPCSignalTaskforce_DecemberWorkshopSample_production_v09_72_00_06_bnbmajority_larcv > filelist.txt`

Then you can run `bash process_metadata.sh filelist.txt filelist_meta.txt`
This step gets the metadata of files then create an output file in `filename checksum size` format 

filelist_meta.txt becomes the `filelist` arguement in the ingestion script, https://github.com/bjwhite-fnal/spellbook/blob/main/rucio/rbipi.py 

rbipi.py doesn't handle if `filelist` is too long. It's recommended to break down the input file into smaller text files (~1000 lines).
(e.g. `split -dl 1000 --additional-suffix=.txt filelist_meta.txt filelist_meta_)

then 
`python3 rbipi.py `YOUR_DATASET_NAME` SLAC_SDF filelist_meta_00.txt --rucio-account=icaruspro` will create a dataset and add the file to the dataset and ingest.

After ingestion, files should be transferred to SLAC_SDF via running some script like,

#!/bin/bash                                                                                                                                                    

while read -r line
do
    rucio upload $line --rse SLAC_SDF --register-after-upload
done < full_path.txt

where `full_path.txt` is full file path in \pnfs (if you are working in FNAL servers).
